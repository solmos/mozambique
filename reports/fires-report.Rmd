## Fire counts

Observations of fire events are available from the beginning of 2012 to the end of 2018.

```{r}
fire_events <- read_csv2(here("data", "simplified.csv")) %>%
  rename(date = ACQ_DATE)
fire_counts <- fire_events %>%
  count(date)
ggplot(fire_counts, aes(date, n)) +
  geom_point()
```
